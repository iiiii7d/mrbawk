<h2>Introduction</h2>
<b> Your guild is mundane. </b> The channels are quieter than usual. All you need is <b> a pet. </b><br>
This is what Mr Bawk is for: to provide entertainment like how a parrot would, with being able to repeat someone, detect someone for swearing, or to talk over someone (in chat), plus a currency system, a quoting function, being able to mess up images, a reaction game, and more! <br>
Founded on 24 March by i____7d#5755, this parrot aims to provide fun for all.

<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>Latest version: v1.11 (2/10/20)</h3>
<ul>
<li>`parrot c bowls` now shows your bowls in pages... for those who have too many of them</li>
<li>Item prices & achievements now follow an exponential rate depending on no. of parrots & levels respectively, preventing inflation</li>
<li>Swearing counter! Note that swears will be detected only if swearing detection is on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Initialisation Guide</h2>
When you first invite Mr Bawk into the server, a new role is automatically created called "Parrot Master". Give this role to yourself and some others so that they can use the master commands of Mr Bawk.<br>
You are also recommended to look at the server preferences (parrot s), when you are a Parrot Master. You are highly recommended to set a specific channel for announcements (in annchannel) as that is where updates for version updating or other messages from me will be posted to. Feel free to look at the other options.

<h2>More about this bot</h2>
If a bug occurs within the code, a report would be sent to i____7d, in the support server.<br>
If you detect anything that is wrong with the bot, but no error message is produced, go and tell i____7d (in the support server).<br><br>

Nevertheless, have fun with my bot :)
